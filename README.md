Hey there, and welcome to the MatrixUHC repo!  
- 
I figured that I'd create some projects to build up more of a public portfolio for myself, whilst also making something that can be used by the community... Hence, here we are! 

This is a simple UHC plugin - once complete, it will work out-of-the box and without any issues. However, it will also hopefully be one of the easiest UHC plugins to customize in every way possible. That's what I'm aiming for whilst making this project - I have made a proprietary UHC plugin in the past, but it wasn't really tweakable. 

Any develoeprs, if you'd like to contribute in any way, feel free to do so via a pull request.
